10)The Data structure used in standard implementation of Breadth First Search is?
Answer:-Queue

9)Which of the follwing is TRUE?S1: Suppose we do a DFS on a directed graph G.
If we remove all of the back edges found, the resulting graph is now acyclic.
S2: For a directed graph, the absence of back edges with respect to a BFS tree
implies that the graph is acyclic.
Answer:-s1 is true and s2 is false

8)Is the following statement true.A DFS of a directed graph always produces the
same number of tree edges,
i.e.independent of the order in which the vertices are considered for DFS.
Answer:-No

7)Traversal of a graph is different than tree because.
Answer:- there can be a loop in the graph

6)Regarding implementation of Depth First Search using stacks,
what is the maximum distance between two nodes present in the stack?
(considering each edge length 1)
Answer:- Can be anything

5)Choose the incorrect statement about DFS and BFS from the following?
Answer:-Dfs is equivalent to post order traversal in tree

4)The Depth First Search traversal of a graph will result into?
Answer:- Tree

3)The Data structure used in standard implementation of Depth First Search is?
Answer:- Stack

2)Time Complexity of DFS is? (V – number of vertices, E – number of edges)
Answer:- O(V+E)

1)Depth First Search is equivalent to which of the traversal in the Binary Trees?
Answer:- pre-order Traversal
